PACT-test, integration test and check list are a part of internal testing that the banks complete before testing with the
public sector starts. They are meant to be tools to help the banks to ensure correct and good quality of the implementation.

First time implementing a DSOP solution based on the DSOP Control Common Standard: all banks must complete all cases in
"check list and integration test" and complete "PACT-test". This is to ensure that the banks' implementation and
interpretation of the documentation is correct.
