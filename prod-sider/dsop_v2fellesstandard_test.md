The integration test and check list are a part of the internal testing that the data providers must complete
before testing with the public sector before a DSOP solution can be put into production. These tools  are meant to help
the data providers  to ensure  that their implementation of the DSOP Common Standard in the various DSOP
Solutions is correct and meets the standard of quality.

The first time implementing a DSOP solution based on the DSOP Control Common Standard, all data providers must
complete all cases in "check list and integration test". This is to ensure that the implementation and interpretation
of the documentation is correct. Additionally, the data provider must answer questions regarding compliance.

* [Check list and integration test](assets/Kontrollinformasjon - Sjekkliste og integrasjonstest - V2.xlsx) <br \/> Check
  list and integration test is a tool to ensure that the banks have interpreted the documentation correctly, and to
  simplify the testing process with the public entities.

* [Answer questions regarding compliance (spørsmål om etterlevelse og evt. avvik)](assets/Kontrollinformasjon - avvik og etterlevelse.xlsx)

When the data provider has implemented the DSOP Control Common Standard in relation to a given DSOP Solution and
is going to onboard a new DSOP Solution that is based on the same Standard, the data provider will not need to
complete the cases in "check list and integration test" unless there is a change in the DSOP Control API version.
