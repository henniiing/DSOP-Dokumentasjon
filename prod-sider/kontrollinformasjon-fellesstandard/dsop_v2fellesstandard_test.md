The integration test and check list are a part of the internal testing that the data providers must complete
before testing with the public sector before a DSOP solution can be put into production. These tools  are meant to help
the data providers  to ensure  that their implementation of the DSOP Common Standard in the various DSOP
Solutions is correct and meets the standard of quality.

The first time implementing a DSOP solution based on the DSOP Control Common Standard, all data providers must
complete all cases in "check list and integration test". This is to ensure that the implementation and interpretation
of the documentation is correct. Additionally, the data provider must answer questions regarding compliance.
