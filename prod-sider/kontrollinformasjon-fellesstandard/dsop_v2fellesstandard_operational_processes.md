All data providers and data consumers that have implemented Control Information must incorporate the operational
processes into internal routines. It is a prerequisite that both the data providers and the data consumers
that have implemented this solution, arrange their own routines and systems so that the routines defined below function
appropriately. The 5 operational processes for DSOP Control Common Standard are presented in the table below.
