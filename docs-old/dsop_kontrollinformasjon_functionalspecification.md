This page describes the deliveries at the functional level from the solution, DSOP Kontrollinformasjon (Control Information). This document does not consider the ways in which this is solved in the various technical calls, but it is described in the architecture document and the API documentation. The current process is manual and time-consuming both for the government agencies and the financial institutions. The digitised and standardised solution used by the government agencies for obtaining account information from the financial institutions leads to both a simpler and more efficient process, as well as higher quality of data. Furthermore, the digital solution provides increased security and traceability in regard to the processing of account information, and allows for increased automation of processes.

For general functional specification, see the page for the [Common standard functional specification](/dsop_kontroll_functionalspecification). This page concerns the particulars for Skatteetaten, NAV and the Police.


## General information about volume and response times

Response times will vary, but the typical pattern is that requests for up-to-date data that can be delivered “online” will have fast response times (seconds), while large historical queries may take longer. Volume and response times will be specified in more detail in the technical course/collaboration.

### Volume Skatteetaten (the Norwegian Tax Administration)

The Tax Administration currently collects information from the financial institutions manually via email, letter and fax. It has not been possible to find the exact figures for the number of requests made to the financial institutions regarding control information, so an estimate has been made based on feedback from the operating units on the number of requests. The estimates are based on requests made by the Regions (in 2018), the Norwegian National Collection Agency and the Tax Collectors. The table below shows the estimated volume of the number of requests to the financial institutions from the Tax Administration.

* The increase in the number of balance requests is estimated to be small, as information about this currently is obtained in cases where it is necessary.
* The volume of collection of transactions and balances is expected to increase substantially, as in many cases no collection is currently made due to the long response time, and the Tax Administration would like to make greater use of this by automating the processes in the future.

| Total volume per Annum for requests to financial institutions | Estimated current number | Estimated future number |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Request about transactions and balance                        | 15 585                   | 207 500                 |
| Request about balance                                         | 167 581                  | 	185 000                |
| **Total**	                                                    | 183 166                  | 	392 500                |

### Volume Police

When the collection of control information becomes automated and structured through this project, a large increase in requests to the banks is expected from the Police Districts, Kripos, Økokrim (The National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime) and the Financial Intelligence Unit (EFE).

The bailiff (namsmannen) receives 411 000 cases per year. In all these cases, control information should be collected, but a very small proportion is currently collected. In the long term, Control Information should be used in all cases, but in the first instance it is expected to cover a little over half of the cases.

See specific figures in the table below.

| Total volume per annum for requests to financial institutions	        | Estimated current number | Estimated future number |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Request about transactions and balance from PD, Kripos, Økokrim, EFE	 | 15 000                   | 50 000                  |
| Request about transactions and balance from the Bailiffs	             | 8 143                    | 250 000                 |
| **Total**                                                             | 23 143                   | 300 000                 |

*Note: The figures for expected volume come from feedback from the professional communities, and the current volume is estimated based on insight from some of the banks.*

### Volume NAV (The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration)

The table below shows the estimated volume of the number of requests to the financial institutions from NAV.

| Total volume per Annum for requests to financial institutions	 | Estimated current number | Estimated future number |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Request about transactions and balance                         | 5 000                    | 20 000                  |
